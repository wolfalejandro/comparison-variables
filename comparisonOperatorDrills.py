#1) Check if "dog" is equal to "cat" and store the answer in variable b
b= "dog" == "cat"
print(b)
#2) Check if 1.24 is equal to 1.25 and store the answer in variable c
c= 1.24 == 1.25
print(c)
#3) Check if True is equal to False and store the answer in variable d
d= True == False
print(d)
#4) Check if [1,2,3] is equal to [1,2,3] and store the answer in variable e
e= [1,2,3] == [1,2,3]
print(e)
#5) Check if 1 is less than or equal to 2 and store the answer in variable f
f= 1 <= 2
print(f)
#6) Check if 1 is greater than or equal to 2 and store the answer in variable g
g= 1 >= 2
print(g)
#7) Check if 1.66 is greater than or equal to 1.67 and store the answer in variable h
h= 1.66 >= 1.67
print(h)
#8) Check if 1.66 is less than or equal to 1.67 and store the answer in variable i
i= 1.66 <= 1.67
print(i)
#9) Check if 1 is less than 2 and store the answer in variable j
j= 1 < 2
print(j)
#10) Check if 1 is greater than 2 and store the answer in variable k
k= 1 > 2
print(k)
#11) Check if 11 divided by three 3 is less than 100 divided by 33 and store the answer
#  ) in variable l
l= 11/3 < 100/33
print(l)
#12) Check if 9 times 7 is greater than 8 times 8 and store the answer in variable m
m= 9*7 > 8*8
print(m)
#13) Check if the square root of 3 is less than 1.15 squared and store the answer in
#  ) variable n
n =  1.73 < 1.15**2
#14) Multiple 8 by 3 and store that in variable o, then divide 56 by 2 and store that
#  ) in variable p, finally check if o is greater then p and store the answer in variable q.
o= 8*3
p= 56/2
q= o > p
#15) Take the square root of 96 and store that in variable r, then square 8.6 and store
#  ) that in variable s, finally check if r is greater than or equal to s and store the
#  ) answer in t
r= 9.79
s= 8.6**2
t= r >= s
